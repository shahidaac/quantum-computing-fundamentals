# quantum-computing-fundamentals
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Quantum Computing Fundamentals. The full course is available from LinkedIn Learning.

The examples in this repo have been updated to utilize the new Qiskit API. This primarily affects the import statements at the beginning of notebooks and the measurements/visualations at the end.


In this course, electrical engineer and educator Barron Stone guides you on deploying quantum computing from a developerâ€™s perspective. Learn about qubits, quantum logic gates, and circuits, running quantum programs with Qiskit, three standard quantum algorithms, and more. This course is a perfect companion to the course Introduction to Quantum Computing.
